In the field of radio astronomy, the large reflector arrays on ground face a growing problem of interference with the signal of interest due to human-made communication satellites, causing signal contamination. This project deals with cancelling of the pattern at the angle of interference without any drastic change in the main lobe of the pattern using electronically reconfigurable surface
